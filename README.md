# Vaadin 8.2.1 integration for OSGi

This project contains an integration for Vaadin 8.2.1 for OSGi, as the current implementation in Vaadin does not work properly outside of Karaf. This implementation also works with felix.http and enables UIs to be DS.

If you are interested in OSGi support for Vaadin Flow (Vaadin 10+) then have a look at the [new integration (WIP)](https://github.com/Sandared/flow-osgi)
